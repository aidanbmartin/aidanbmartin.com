** IN PROGRESS **

Personal website built to learn fundamental web-development concepts to produce an end result that sharpens my online professional presence provides a way for me to host an online photography portfolio. This README will document the site's development process.

## Step 1: Design 
This is my second attempt at building such a website, and I made the mistake of undertaking the website development before I had a concrete design in mind beforehand. This quickly became a problem, as I had not even thought about how my website should respond when viewed on screens of different sizes. This time around, I began my design in Figma, starting with mobile first, to provide myself with a visual skeleton to follow when programming.

## Step 2: Development
My first goal in the development process was to initialize my files and file structure. I chose to use a SCSS to CSS compiler to allow me to use variables and functions in the styling of the site. I also wanted to get the site published so that I could ensure that my media queries were working. URL is aidanbmartin.com, purchased through Google Domains and hosted with Netlify. I used the inlude-media SASS project (https://eduardoboucas.github.io/include-media) to handle my media queries and breakpoints.
