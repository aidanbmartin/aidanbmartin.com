Personal website built to learn fundamental web-development concepts to produce an end result that sharpens my online professional presence provides a way for me to host an online photography portfolio.

## Step 1: Design 
This is my second attempt at building such a website, and I made the mistake of undertaking the website development before I had a concrete design in mind beforehand. This quickly became a problem, as I had not even thought about how my website should respond when viewed on screens of different sizes. This time around, I began my design in Figma, starting with mobile first, to provide myself with a visual skeleton to follow when programming.
